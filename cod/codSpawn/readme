mod4
trying mod3 below but with total landings from 1960-1968 removed

mod3
initial values were too high in previous model; reduced the maximum initial values; started model in 1955; fixed all selectivity

mod2
the model below was just steady-state all the way through, so I tweaked a few more parameters and estimating growth now

mod1
tweaked some of the parameters a bit. mostly tightened up the lower and upper bounds on things. trying a model with growth as fixed.
